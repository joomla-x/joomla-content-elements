An accordion is a graphical control element comprising a vertically stacked list of items, such as labels or
thumbnails. Each item can be "expanded" or "stretched" to reveal the content associated with that item. There can
be zero expanded items, exactly one, or more than one item expanded at a time, depending on the configuration.

The term stems from the musical accordion in which sections of the bellows can be expanded by pulling outward.

A common example of an accordion is the Show/Hide operation of a box region, but extended to have multiple sections
in a list.

An accordion is similar in purpose to a tabbed interface, a list of items where exactly one item is expanded into a
panel (i.e. list items are shortcuts to access separate panels).

Several buttons or labels are stacked upon one another. At most one of them can be "active". When a button is active
the space below the button is used to display a paned window. The pane is usually constrained by the width of labels.
When opened it shifts labels under the clicked label down according to the height of that window. Only one button or
pane combination can be active at any one time; when a button is selected any other active panes cease to be active
and are hidden. The active pane may have scrollbars.

- Brings windows together which ought to have some relation to each other.
- One window available at a time: to reduce information "overload" only one window is "opened".
- Unavailable windows are "shortcutted" / shaded to make choice faster. Chat program Google Talk rewrites window
  labels to indicate important states like "someone is writing" ...
- All windows stacked on each other together - see Fitts's law for further information about it.
